				<p>Learning to code in Python is easier and more useful than learning to write in English.
				In fact you can write programs in the Python language that requires less
				syntax than other programming languages. A lot humans like to beat
				around the bush when it comes to programming by using complex programming
				environments such as IDLE, ATOM, Eclipse, etc. However, the easiest way to use
				Python is using a text editor (GNU Nano for Linux, or NotePad for Windows), 
			 	just make sure to save your file with the extension .py which is standard 
				for Python files. For example, we can write a program called example.py,
				and then we run it in the command line by entering the command 
				<code>python example.py</code></p>
				<p>The simplest Python program that you can write is with a simple print 
				statement. <code>print(thing)</code> where the command <code>print</code> 
				will tell
				the computer to print to the screen the value of the variable 
				<code>'thing'</code>.</p>
				<li>example code:</li>
				<code>print(thing)</code>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="Statements">
				<header>Statements</header>
				<a name="Statements"></a>
				<p>Statements are the workhorse of Python. They allow your program to
				make decisions based on logic. For example if you wanted to make a 
				program that triggered an alarm if a door was opened without using a
				key then you can do this easily using an 'if' statement: 
				<code>if (door open) and (no key used):</code> trigger alarm.</p>
				<p>If you had a program that required the use of the same logic statements
				several times then you can put those statements in a function. A function in
				Python is a set of operations that can be used by typing the function name. 
				In Python we define a function using the syntax: <code>def function():</code></p>
				<li>example code</li>
				<code>def function():</code>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="Data">
				<header>Data</header>
				<a name="Data"></a>
				<p>Some basic ideas in data for Python are: variables, lists, tuples, and 
				dictionaries. A variable is a string of characters that holds a value. For
				example, <code>dollar = 100 * penny</code> the variable <code>dollar</code>
				holds the value of 100 pennies. A variable can be any string of characters
				like dollar, however, you can't start a variable with a special character
				such as * or /, nor can you start a variable with an integer such as 2 or 8.</p>
				<p>Perhaps the most widely used data structure is the list which is a set of 
				items of the same type, such as <code>[1,3,89,29]</code> or 
				<code>[soda, coffee, water]</code>. In this case, the lists holds integers and 
				strings. tuples are a special type of list because a tuple is a list, but the 
				items in this list is another list which holds 2 items only. An example of a 
				tuple is <code>[[soda,1.25],[water,0.99],[coffee,3.25]]</code> which is a list 
				of items that are lists with 2 items each.</p>
				<p>A dictionary is a data structure that is similar to a list because it holds
				items, and it is similar to a tuple because each item is a set of 2 things. These
				'things' are called a key and a value. In python you use dictionaries just as you 
				would use a word dictionary, in order to find the a definition (value) you need
				to know what word (key) to find. Python keeps a dictionary as an unordered set of 
				'key:value' pairs. you define a dictionary as simple as 
				<code>my_dictionary = {}</code> this statement creates an variable 
				<code>my_dictionary</code> that holds an empty dictionary.</p>

			<section class="main-section" id="Applications">
				<a name="Applications"></a>
				<header>Applications</header>
				<p>Some of the many things that you can use Python programs for include:
				prototyping, back-end web development, data anaylsis, databases, android
				applications, and even microcontrollers (microPython)</p>
				<p>Another big application for Python is machine learning. This is especially
				true in the field of deep-learning which is why many languages like Keras and 
				Tensorflow have sprung up. The field of machine learning is dominated by Python
				which is also closely tied to the field of data science.</p>
				<li>example code</li>
				<code>for x in file:</code>
			</section>
			<section class="main-section" id="Conclusion">
				<header>Conclusion</header>
				<a name="Conclusion"></a>
				<p>The big reason why people should be programming, even if you are not a 
				programmer by profession is because coding can help you solve problems that 
				encounter in your daily life. An example is creating a Python dictionary that
				holds inventory of the food supply in your home, you can make a catalog the most
				used items in your kitchen and record how much of those items you have. Then as 
				you use them you subtract the quantity used from the previous amount and then you
				can make a program that uses logic statements to decide if you need to buy more 
				of a product the next time you go shopping.</p>
				<p>In conclusion, every person on the planet should know how to program in Python
				because it offers a lot of control of your computer and allows people who use it 
				the curiosity to explore more applications and uses for Python.</p>
